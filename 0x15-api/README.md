# What is an API?

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.

# What are microservices

Microservices is an architectural approach in software development where an application is divided into small, independent services that are loosely coupled and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Each service typically focuses on a specific business functionality and communicates with other services via APIs.

# PEP8 Python style - having a clean code respecting style guide is really appreciated in the industry

PEP8 is a style guide for writing Python code, established by the Python community. It defines guidelines and best practices for formatting code, naming conventions, and code structure to ensure consistency and readability. Adhering to PEP8 standards is highly valued in the industry as it promotes clean, maintainable, and easy-to-understand code.
