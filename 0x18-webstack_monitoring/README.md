# Server and Application Monitoring

## What is Server Monitoring?

Server monitoring involves tracking and analyzing the performance, availability, and health of servers. It includes monitoring hardware resources such as CPU, memory, disk space, and network usage. The goal is to ensure servers are operating efficiently and to detect and resolve issues before they impact performance or availability.

## What is Application Monitoring?

Application monitoring focuses on tracking the performance, availability, and behavior of software applications. It involves monitoring application components such as code execution, database queries, API calls, and user interactions. The goal is to ensure applications are functioning as expected, identify performance bottlenecks, and troubleshoot issues affecting user experience.

## System Monitoring by Google

Google offers various tools and services for system monitoring, including:

- **Google Cloud Monitoring**: A service that provides monitoring, logging, and diagnostics for applications running on Google Cloud Platform. It allows users to monitor performance metrics, set up alerts, and troubleshoot issues in real-time.

- **Google Stackdriver**: A comprehensive monitoring, logging, and diagnostics suite for cloud-native applications. It offers features such as centralized logging, distributed tracing, and application performance monitoring (APM).

## Nginx Logging and Monitoring

Nginx, a popular web server and reverse proxy, offers logging and monitoring capabilities to track server performance and user requests. Key features include:

- **Access Logging**: Nginx can log detailed information about incoming HTTP requests, including client IP addresses, request methods, response status codes, and request processing times.

- **Error Logging**: Nginx can log errors and warnings encountered during request processing, helping administrators identify and troubleshoot issues affecting server performance or availability.

- **Third-party Modules**: Nginx supports third-party modules and integrations for enhanced logging and monitoring capabilities. For example, the Nginx Amplify module provides advanced monitoring and analytics features for Nginx servers.
