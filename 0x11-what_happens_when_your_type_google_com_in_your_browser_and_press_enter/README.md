# Full-Stack Software Engineering: Infrastructure Overview

Assessing an engineer's understanding of infrastructure involves probing various components:

1. **Network Infrastructure:**
   - Data transmission methods.
   - Network topologies and their pros/cons.
   - Router, switch, and firewall roles.
   - Common protocols: TCP/IP, UDP, HTTP, HTTPS.

2. **Server Infrastructure:**
   - Server roles in software systems.
   - Types: web, app, database servers.
   - Virtualization, cloud concepts.
   - Load balancing, monitoring tools.

3. **Security Infrastructure:**
   - Threats, vulnerabilities.
   - Security techniques: encryption, VPNs.
   - Authentication, authorization.
   - Intrusion detection/prevention.

4. **Storage Infrastructure:**
   - Storage types: local, NAS, cloud.
   - Redundancy, fault tolerance (e.g., RAID).
   - Backup, recovery strategies.
   - Scalability considerations.

5. **Monitoring and Logging Infrastructure:**
   - Performance, availability monitoring.
   - Log management, analysis.
   - Alerting mechanisms.
   - Performance tuning based on monitoring data.
