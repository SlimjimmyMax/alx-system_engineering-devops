# Networking Fundamentals

## OSI Model

The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven abstraction layers. These layers, from the lowest to the highest, are:

1. **Physical**
2. **Data Link**
3. **Network**
4. **Transport**
5. **Session**
6. **Presentation**
7. **Application**

## LAN (Local Area Network)

- **What it is:** A LAN is a network of interconnected computers within a limited area, such as a home, office, or campus.
- **Typical usage:** Local file sharing, printer sharing, and resource sharing.
- **Typical geographical size:** Usually spans a short distance, like a single building or a group of nearby buildings.

## WAN (Wide Area Network)

- **What it is:** A WAN is a network that covers a broad area, often across cities or countries, connecting multiple LANs.
- **Typical usage:** Connecting geographically separated offices, data centers, or cloud resources.
- **Typical geographical size:** Spans a large geographic area, potentially covering a city, country, or even global connections.

## Internet

- **What it is:** The Internet is a global network of interconnected networks, allowing communication and information sharing worldwide.
- **Typical usage:** Web browsing, email, online services, and data exchange.
  
## IP Address

- **What it is:** An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network.
  
## Types of IP Addresses

- **IPv4:** The most widely used version of the Internet Protocol, using 32-bit addresses.
- **IPv6:** Developed to address the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses, it uses 128-bit addresses.

## localhost

- **What it is:** The localhost refers to the current device used to access it, commonly used for testing and development.

## Subnet

- **What it is:** A subnet is a smaller network within a larger network, often used to improve performance and security.

## Why IPv6 was Created

- **Reason:** IPv6 was created due to the exhaustion of available IPv4 addresses as more devices connected to the internet.

## TCP/UDP

- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol):** A connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable and ordered delivery of data.
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol):** A connectionless protocol that provides faster but less reliable data transmission.

## Mainly Used Data Transfer Protocols

- **TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol):** The foundational suite of protocols for the Internet.

## Main Difference Between TCP and UDP

- **Difference:** TCP provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of data, while UDP provides faster but less reliable delivery.

## Port

- **What it is:** A port is a communication endpoint in an operating system that identifies a specific process or service.

## SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS Port Numbers

- **SSH (Secure Shell):** Port 22
- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):** Port 80
- **HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure):** Port 443

## Network Connectivity Tool/Protocol

- **Ping:** A commonly used tool/protocol to check if a device is connected to a network.
