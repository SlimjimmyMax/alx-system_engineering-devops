## Key Aspects of Debugging

1. **Identifying Issues:** Understanding the problem and locating where it occurs in your code.

2. **Error Messages:** Analyzing error messages to pinpoint the root cause of the issue.

3. **Code Review:** Carefully reviewing your code for logical errors and inefficiencies.

4. **Testing:** Writing and running tests to validate the functionality of your code.

## Debugging Tools

There are various tools available for debugging, including:

- Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
- Logging and Print Statements
- Version Control Systems
- Profilers and Performance Analysis Tools

Remember, debugging is not just about fixing errors; it's also about improving your code and making it more robust.
